# hello-world
Hello, fellow humans!

I used to code when I was a kid, and I decided to get back into the tech world at age 35. I'm currently studying to get my CCNA, and eventually get my CCNP. I'm also pursuing a degree online and am learning to use python. My plan is to expand my coding skills along with my networking skills and pursue a new career (currently am truck driver).
